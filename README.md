# Visage Access - Face Recognition Gate Entry System

Visage Access is a Flutter-based gate entry system designed to facilitate the entry and exit of students by scanning their faces. This application provides a seamless solution for tracking the movements of students entering or exiting a specific location, such as a school, university, or any other institution. By utilizing face recognition technology, Visage Access ensures secure and efficient access management.

## Features

- **Face Recognition**: The app uses advanced face recognition algorithms to identify and authenticate students.
- **Entry and Exit Tracking**: Visage Access records the entry and exit times of students, providing accurate attendance tracking.
- **User Registration**: Students can register their faces within the app for seamless access management.
- **Secure Access**: Only registered students with authorized faces can gain entry, ensuring security and preventing unauthorized access.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The intuitive interface makes it easy for both students and administrators to use the application effectively.

## Usage

1. Upon launching the application, users will be prompted to register their faces. They can do so by following the on-screen instructions.
2. After registration, users can use the app to scan their faces at the gate entry point.
3. The app will authenticate the user's identity and record their entry time.
4. When users exit the premises, they can scan their faces again, and the app will log their exit time.
5. Administrators can view entry and exit logs within the app to track attendance and monitor access.
